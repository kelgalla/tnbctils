# tnbctils

This repository includes code and processed data from a project I started in 2017 when I was a fourth year medical student at Indiana University and did not complete until I was a third year resident physician at Johns Hopkins. Clinical demands are high during medical school and residency, and so the code is not as organized or documented as optimally as I would like.

The workflow for processing TCGA data is described in tnbctils/brcatcga/analysis/ANALYSIS/workflow.txt and most R files have a general description at the top of the file describing their general purpose. Since this project has moved from one institution to another, I have updated many paths to reflect the repository structure, but some are outdated and most are hard-coded.
